Here,


is a Jacobian matrix whose


th column is the gradient with respect


to the


th action dimension of the policy under parameterization


. An example


for this term is given in example 13.1. The gradient


is a vector


that indicates how much our estimated action value changes as we perturb the


action given by our policy at state


. In addition to the Jacobian, we need to supply


this gradient to use this method.


Example 13.1. An example of the
