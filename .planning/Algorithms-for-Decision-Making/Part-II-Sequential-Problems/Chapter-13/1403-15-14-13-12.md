The plot here compares Monte Carlo tree search on 2048 using rollouts


with a uniform random policy, rollouts with a one-step lookahead policy, the


two evaluation functions, and using the current board score:

There are variations of this basic Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that can


better handle large action and state spaces. Instead of expanding all the actions,


we can use

can be used to handle large as well as continuous action and state spaces.
