The pseudoinverse of the diagonal matrix


is obtained by taking the reciprocal


of each nonzero element of the diagonal and then transposing the result.


Figure 8.13 shows how the utilities of states in


are fit with several basis


function families. Different choices of basis functions result in different errors.


cubic


quadratic


sinusoidal

different basis function families.


Algorithm 8.6 provides an implementation for evaluating and fitting linear


regression models of the value function. Example 8.3 demonstrates this approach


with the mountain car problem.
