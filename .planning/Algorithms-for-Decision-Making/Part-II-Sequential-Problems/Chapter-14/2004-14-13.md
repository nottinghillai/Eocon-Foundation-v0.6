If

we are trying to estimate in equation (14.1).


Although equation (14.13) is generally not practical to compute exactly (this


is why we are using importance sampling in the first place), it can provide some


intuition as to how to use our domain expertise to construct a proposal distribution.


m/s


It is common to bias the initial state distribution or the transition model slightly


toward more important trajectories, such as toward collision.

To illustrate the construction of an importance distribution, we will use the
