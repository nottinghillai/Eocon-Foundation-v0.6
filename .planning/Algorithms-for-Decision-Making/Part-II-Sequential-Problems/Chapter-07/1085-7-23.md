where

are matrices that determine how state and action component


combinations contribute reward. We additionally require that

and actions that deviate from


Problems with linear dynamics and quadratic reward are common in control


theory where one often seeks to regulate a process such that it does not deviate


far from a desired value. The quadratic cost assigns a much higher cost to states


far from the origin than to those near it. The optimal policy for a problem with


linear dynamics and quadratic reward has an analytic, closed-form solution.


Many MDPs can be approximated with linear quadratic MDPs and solved, often


yielding reasonable policies for the original problem.


Substituting the transition and reward functions into equation (7.21) produces
