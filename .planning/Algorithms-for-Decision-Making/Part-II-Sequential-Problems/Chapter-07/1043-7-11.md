We refer to this policy as a


greedy policy


with respect to


. If


is the optimal


value function, then the extracted policy is optimal. Algorithm 7.5 implements


this idea.


An alternative way to represent a policy is to use the


action value function


sometimes called the


-function


. The action value function represents the expected


return when starting in state


, taking action


, and then continuing with the


greedy policy with respect to
