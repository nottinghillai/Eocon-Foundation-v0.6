, provide bounds


on the posterior probability of winning after


10


additional pulls.


Solution:


A lower bound on our posterior probability of winning


can be computed


assuming that all pulls result in a loss, (e.g.,


10


and


). We can similarly compute


an upper bound


, assuming that all pulls result in a win (e.g.,


10


and


). The


bounds are thus

Exercise 15.4.


Suppose that we have a bandit with arms


and


, and we use an


-greedy


exploration strategy with


0.3


and an exploration decay factor of


0.9


. We generate


a random number


between


and


to determine if we explore (


) or exploit (


).


Given we have


, which arm is selected if
