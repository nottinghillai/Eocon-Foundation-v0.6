This equation is implemented in algorithm 7.2. Iterative policy evaluation is


implemented in algorithm 7.3. Several iterations are shown in figure 7.3.


The value function


can be computed to an arbitrary precision given suffi-


cient iterations of the lookahead equation. Convergence is guaranteed because the

At convergence, the following equality holds:
