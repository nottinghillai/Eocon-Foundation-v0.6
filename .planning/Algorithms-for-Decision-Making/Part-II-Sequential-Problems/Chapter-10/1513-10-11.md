This estimate depends on the evaluated expected utility, which itself can vary


widely. We can make our gradient estimate more resilient with


rank shaping


which replaces the utility values with weights based on the relative performance


of each sample to the other samples in its iteration. The


samples are sorted in


descending order of expected utility. Weight


is assigned to sample


according


to a weighting scheme with
