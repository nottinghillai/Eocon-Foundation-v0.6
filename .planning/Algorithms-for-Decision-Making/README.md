## About This Book

This book provides a broad introduction to algorithms for decision making under
uncertainty. It covers a wide variety of topics related to decision making,
introducing the underlying mathematical problem formulations and the algorithms
for solving them.

The book is intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, as well
as professionals in fields including mathematics, statistics, computer science,
aerospace, electrical engineering, and operations research.

All algorithms in the book are implemented in the **Julia programming language**.
