As done in earlier chapters, we can transform the maximization over the product

to a sum over


log


Depending on how we want to represent the conditional distribution


we may compute the maximum likelihood estimate of


analytically. For example,


if we use a discrete conditional model (section 2.4),


would consist of the counts


from
