# Mars Science Exploration

_Source page: 27_



Rovers have made important discoveries on and increased our understanding


of Mars. However, a major bottleneck in scientific exploration has been the com-


munication link between the rover and the operations team on Earth. It can take


as much as half an hour for sensor information to be sent from Mars to Earth


and for commands to be sent from Earth to Mars. In addition, guidance to rovers


needs to be planned in advance because there are limited upload and download


windows with Mars due to the positions of orbiters serving as information relays


between the planets. Recent research has suggested that the efficiency of science


exploration missions can be improved by a factor of five through the introduction
