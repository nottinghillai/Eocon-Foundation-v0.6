Table 2.1. Example of a joint distri-


If the variables are discrete, the joint distribution can be represented by a table like


bution involving binary variables


, and


the one shown in table 2.1. That table lists all the possible assignments of values


to three binary variables. Each variable can only be


or


, resulting in


possible assignments. As with other discrete distributions, the probabilities in
