Exercise 2.1.


Consider a continuous random variable


that follows the


exponential distri-


bution


parameterized by


with density


) =


exp


with nonnegative support.


Compute the cumulative distribution function of


Solution:


We start with the definition of the cumulative distribution function. Since the


support of the distribution is lower-bounded by


, there is no probability mass in


the interval


, 0


, allowing us to adjust the lower bound of the integral to


. After


computing the integral, we obtain cdf


cdf

Exercise 2.2.


For the density function in figure 2.6, what are the five components of the


mixture? (There are multiple valid solutions.)


Solution:


One solution is
