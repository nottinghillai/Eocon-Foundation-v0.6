Asymptotic notation


is often used to characterize the growth of a function. This


notation is sometimes called


big-Oh notation


, since the letter


is used because


the growth rate of a function is often called its


order


. This notation can be used


to describe the error associated with a numerical method or the time or space


complexity of an algorithm. This notation provides an upper bound on a function


as its argument approaches a certain value.


Mathematically, if
