# Conditional Distributions

_Source page: 51_



The previous section introduced the idea of independence, which can help reduce


the number of parameters used to define a joint distribution. However, as was


mentioned, independence can be too strong of an assumption. This section will


introduce the idea of conditional independence, which can help reduce the num-


ber of independent parameters without making assumptions that are as strong.


Before discussing conditional independence, we will first introduce the notion of


conditional distribution


, which is a distribution over a variable given the value of


one or more other ones.


The definition of


conditional probability


states that
