# Probabilistic Reasoning

_Source page: 36_



Rational decision making requires reasoning about our uncertainty and objectives.


This part of the book begins by discussing how to represent uncertainty as a prob-


ability distribution. Real-world problems require reasoning about distributions


over many variables. We will discuss how to construct these models, how to use


them to make inferences, and how to learn their parameters and structure from


data. We then introduce the foundations of


utility theory


and show how it forms


the basis for rational decision making under uncertainty through the maximum


expected utility principle. We then discuss how notions of utility theory can be


incorporated into the probabilistic graphical models introduced earlier in this


chapter to form what are called


decision networks
