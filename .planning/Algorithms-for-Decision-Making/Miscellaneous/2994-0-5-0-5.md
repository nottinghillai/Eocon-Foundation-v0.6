The jagged bounds are due to some beliefs not being reexplored based on


the action and observation selection. In the bottom row, we see that it has


explored many of the beliefs once, but the bounds are still loose. Heuristic


search seeks to reduce the maximum gap.

Heuristic search intelligently selects action-observation pairs to explore regions


with a high gap between the upper and lower bounds on the value function


that it maintains.
