Kullback-Leibler divergence. After


computing the natural policy gra-


dient ascent direction, a line search


is conducted to ensure that the up-


dated policy improves the policy


reward and adheres to the diver-


gence constraint. The line search


starts from the estimated maxi-


mum step size and reduces the step


size along the ascent direction until


a satisfactory point is found.
