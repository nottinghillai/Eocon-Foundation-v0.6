. The colon notation is


sometimes used in programming


shorthand when discussing the assignment of values to variables. For example,


languages, such as Julia and MAT-


is shorthand for

binary variable


, it can take on the value of


LAB.


Julia, like many other program-


true or false.


We will use


to represent false and


to represent true. For example,


ming languages, similarly treats


we use


to represent the probability that

2.2. probability distributions

The


parameters


of a distribution govern the probabilities associated with differ-


ent assignments. For example, if we use


to represent the outcome of a roll of


dx


a six-sided die, then we would have
