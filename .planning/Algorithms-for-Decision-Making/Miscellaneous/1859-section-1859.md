We can obtain an unbiased estimate of this expectation through rollout trajectories,


as done in the policy gradient estimation methods (chapter 11). However, the


estimate is high variance, meaning that we need many samples to arrive at an


accurate estimate.

The approach taken by generalized advantage estimation is to balance between


these two extremes of using temporal difference residuals and full rollouts. We


define


to be the advantage estimate obtained from


steps of a rollout and
