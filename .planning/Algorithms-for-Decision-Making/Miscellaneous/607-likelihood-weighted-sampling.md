# Likelihood Weighted Sampling

_Source page: 79_



The problem with direct sampling is that we may waste time generating samples


that are inconsistent with the observations, especially if the observations are


unlikely. An alternative approach is called


likelihood weighted sampling


, which


involves generating weighted samples that are consistent with the observations.


To illustrate, we will again attempt to infer


. We have a set of


samples, where the


th sample is again denoted


. The weight


of the


th sample is


. The weighted estimate is
