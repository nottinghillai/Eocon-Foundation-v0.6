The Hooke-Jeeves


method applied to optimizing a


policy in the simple regulator prob-


lem discussed in example 10.1. The


evaluations at each iteration are


shown as white points. Iterations


proceed left to right and top to bot-


tom, and the background is colored


according to the expected utility,


with yellow indicating lower util-


ity and dark blue indicating higher


utility.

in the population. Since these evaluations potentially involve many rollout


simulations and are therefore computationally expensive, they are often run in


parallel. These evaluations help us identify the


elite samples


, which are the top

samples according to


The population at the next iteration is generated by producing


new pa-


rameterizations by repeatedly selecting a random elite sample


and perturbing


it with isotropic Gaussian noise,
