The resulting interpolation weighs each vertex according to the area of its opposing


quadrant, as shown in figure 8.8.


Multilinear interpolation


in


dimensions is similarly achieved by linearly inter-


polating along each axis, requiring


vertices. Here too, the utility of each vertex


is weighted according to the volume of the opposing hyperrectangle. Multilin-


ear interpolation is implemented in algorithm 8.4. Figure 8.9 demonstrates this


approach on a two-dimensional state space.
