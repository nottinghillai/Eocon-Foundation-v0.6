joint distribution


is a probability distribution over multiple variables. A distribu-


tion over a single variable is called a


univariate distribution


, and a distribution over


multiple variables is called a


multivariate distribution


. If we have a joint distribution


over two discrete variables


and


, then


denotes the probability that


both


and


From a joint distribution, we can compute a


marginal


distribution of a variable


or a set of variables by summing out all other variables using what is known as


If our distribution is continuous,


the


law of total probability


then we integrate out the other vari-
