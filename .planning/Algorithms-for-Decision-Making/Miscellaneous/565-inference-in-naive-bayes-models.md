chapter.


The previous section presented a general method for performing exact inference in


any Bayesian network. This section discusses how this same method can be used


to solve


classification


problems for a special kind of Bayesian network structure


known as a


naive Bayes


model. This structure is given in figure 3.2. An equivalent


Class


but more compact representation is shown in figure 3.3 using a


plate


, shown here


as a rounded box. The


1 :


in the bottom of the box specifies that the
