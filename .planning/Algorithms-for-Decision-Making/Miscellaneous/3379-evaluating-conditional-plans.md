Recall that a conditional plan (section 20.2) is a tree where actions are associated


with nodes and observations are associated with edges. Each agent has its own


tree and initially selects the action associated with its root. After making an


observation, each agent proceeds down the tree, taking the edge associated with


their observation. The process of taking actions and selecting edges based on


observations continues until reaching the end of the tree. Example 26.2 shows a


joint policy consisting of a conditional plan for each agent.


Example 26.2. A two-agent, two-
