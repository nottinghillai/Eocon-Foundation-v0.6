by a set of bin edges for each variable. These bin edges define a grid over the


variables. We then associate a constant probability density with each grid cell.


The bin edges do not have to be uniformly separated. In some cases, it may be


desirable to have increased resolution around certain values. Different variables


might have different bin edges associated with them. If there are


variables and


bins for each variable, then we need
