Before introducing the definition of a measure space, we will first discuss the


notion of a sigma-algebra over a set


. A sigma-algebra is a collection


of subsets


of


such that

3. If

, then


closed under countable unions

An element


is called a


measurable set


measure space


is defined by a set


, a sigma-algebra


, and a
