While psychologists study human behavior as it happens, neuroscientists focus on


the biological processes used to create the behavior. At the end of the nineteenth


century, scientists found that the brain is composed of an interconnected network


of neurons, which is responsible for its ability to perceive and reason about the


world. Artificial intelligence pioneer Nils Nilsson describes the application of


these findings to decision making as follows:


Because it is the

chapter 1. introduction


In the 1940s, researchers first proposed that neurons could be considered as


individual ‘‘logic units” capable of performing computational operations when


pieced together into a network. This work served as a basis for neural networks,


which are used in the field of artificial intelligence to perform a variety of complex


tasks.
