# Sum-Product Variable Elimination

_Source page: 71_



A variety of methods can be used to perform efficient inference in more compli-


cated Bayesian networks. One method is known as


sum-product variable elimination


which interleaves eliminating hidden variables (summations) with applications


of the chain rule (products). It is more efficient to marginalize variables out as


early as possible to avoid generating large factors.

and the amount of heading fluctuation. The first represents our belief about


whether a target is a bird or an aircraft in the absence of any information


about the track. Here are example class-conditional distributions for airspeed


as estimated from radar data:
