Figure 5.1. A simple Bayesian net-


work to illustrate how the Bayesian


score helps us balance model com-


plexity.


Figure 5.2. Three Bayesian network


structures with varying levels of


complexity.


Figure 5.3 shows how the Bayesian scores of the completely connected and


unconnected models compare to the true model as the amount of data increases.


In the plot, we subtract the score of the true model, so values above


indicate


that the model provides a better representation than the true model, given the


available data. The plot shows that the unconnected model does better than the


true model when there are fewer than


10


samples. The completely connected


model never does better than the true model, but it starts to do better than the


unconnected model at about


10


samples because there are sufficient data to


adequately estimate its seven independent parameters.
