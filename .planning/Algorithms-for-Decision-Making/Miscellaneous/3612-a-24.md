The Taylor expansion represents a function as an infinite sum of polynomial


terms based on repeated derivatives at a single point. Any analytic function can


be represented by its Taylor expansion within a local neighborhood.


A function can be locally approximated by using the first few terms of the Taylor


expansion. Figure A.5 shows increasingly better approximations for


cos


about


. Including more terms increases the accuracy of the local approximation,


but error still accumulates as one moves away from the expansion point.
