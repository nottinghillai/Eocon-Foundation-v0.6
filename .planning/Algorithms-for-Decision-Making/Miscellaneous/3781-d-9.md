ple D.6 demonstrates this process on a latent space learned from handwritten


digits.


Variational autoencoders are derived by representing the encoder as a condi-


tional distribution


, where

is in the unobserved embedding space. The decoder performs inference in the


other direction, representing

distribution. We seek to minimize the KL divergence between
