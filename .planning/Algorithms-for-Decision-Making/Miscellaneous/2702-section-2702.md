chapter 20. exact belief state planning


Policies for these problems can be represented as conditional plans, which are


trees that describe the actions to take based on the observations.


Alpha vectors contain the expected utility when starting from different states


and following a particular conditional plan.


Alpha vectors can also serve as an alternative representation of a POMDP


policy.


POMDP value iteration can avoid the computational burden of enumerating


all conditional plans by iteratively computing subplans and pruning those that


are suboptimal.


Linear Gaussian problems with quadratic reward can be solved exactly using


methods very similar to those derived for the fully observable case.
