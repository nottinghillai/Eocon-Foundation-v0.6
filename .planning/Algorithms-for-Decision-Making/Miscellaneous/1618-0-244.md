. Generally, with more simulation


samples, we can arrive at a better estimate. Some methods can lead to bias,


where—even with infinitely many samples—it does not lead to an accurate


estimate. Sometimes methods with nonzero bias may still be attractive if they


also have low variance, meaning that they require fewer samples to converge.


Here are plots of the estimates from four notional methods for estimating
