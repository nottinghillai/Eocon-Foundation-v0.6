, where the function


is the


minimum number of steps from the given state to the terminal reward state.


The search tree of branch and bound is a subset of that of forward search


because branch and bound can ignore portions it knows are not optimal.


Due to the upper bound, branch and bound evaluates moving right first,


and because that happens to be optimal, it is able to immediately identify the


optimal sequence of actions and avoid exploring other actions. If the start


and goal states were reversed, the search tree would be larger. In the worst


case, it can be as large as forward search.

Branch and bound is not guaranteed to reduce computation over forward


search. Both approaches have the same worst-case time complexity. The efficiency


of the algorithm greatly depends on the heuristic.
