# Controller Abstractions

_Source page: 493_



This chapter introduces controller representations for POMDP policies, which


allow policies to maintain their own internal state. These representations can


improve scalability over previous methods that enumerate over belief points.


This chapter presents algorithms that construct controllers using policy iteration,


nonlinear programming, and gradient ascent.
