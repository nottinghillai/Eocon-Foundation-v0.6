# Summary

_Source page: 147_



• Rational decision making combines probability and utility theory.


The existence of a utility function follows from constraints on rational prefer-


ences.


• A rational decision is one that maximizes expected utility.


Decision problems can be modeled using decision networks, which are exten-


sions of Bayesian networks that include actions and utilities.


Solving a simple decision involves inference in Bayesian networks and is thus


NP-hard.


The value of information measures the gain in expected utility should a new


variable be observed.


• Humans are not always rational.
