Solution:


We interpolate with the belief-utility pairs. For each nonbasis belief, we start by


finding the farthest basis belief,


. Starting with

Exercise 21.5.


Suppose that we have a valid lower bound represented as a set of alpha


vectors


. Is it possible for a backup at a belief state


to result in an alpha vector


, such


′⊤


that


is lower than the utility function represented by


? In other words, can a backup


at a belief


result in an alpha vector that assigns a lower utility to


than the value function


0.5


represented by


Solution:


It is possible. Suppose we have only one action, observations are perfect, there is

a backup at a belief can result in


transition deterministically to

, as


an alpha vector that, on its own,
