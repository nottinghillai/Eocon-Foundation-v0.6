, then our estimate of

the transition probabilities or rewards, then we can initialize

Algorithm 16.1 updates

taking action


and receiving reward


. Algorithm 16.2 converts the maximum


likelihood model into an MDP representation. Example 16.1 illustrates this process.


We can use this maximum likelihood model to select actions while interacting


with the environment and improving the model.
