Operations research


is concerned with finding optimal solutions to decision-making


problems such as resource allocation, asset investment, and maintenance schedul-


ing. In the late nineteenth century, researchers began to explore the application of


mathematical and scientific analysis to the production of goods and services. The


field was accelerated during the Industrial Revolution when companies began to


subdivide their management into departments responsible for distinct aspects of


overall decisions. During World War II, the optimization of decisions was applied


to allocating resources to an army. Once the war came to an end, businesses began


to notice that the same operations research concepts previously used to make


military decisions could help them optimize business decisions. This realization


led to the development of management science, as described by the organizational


theorist Harold Koontz:


The abiding belief of this group is that, if management, or organization, or planning,


or decision making is a logical process, it can be expressed in terms of mathematical


symbols and relationships. The central approach of this school is the model, for it is


through these devices that the problem is expressed in its basic relationships and in
