. The best parame-


terization, unperturbed, is included as the


th sample. Because the evaluations


involve stochastic rollouts, a variation of this algorithm could involve running


additional rollouts to help identify which of the elite samples is truly the best.


Figure 10.4 shows several iterations, or


generations


, of this approach in a sample


problem.
