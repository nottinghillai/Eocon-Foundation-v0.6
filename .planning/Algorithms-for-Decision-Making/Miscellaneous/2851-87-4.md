Thus, we find that moving left is the optimal action for this belief state, despite a higher


probability of being on the right half of the grid world. This is due to the relatively high


likelihood that we assign to being in state


, where we would receive a large, immediate


reward by moving left.


Exercise 21.2.


Recall the simplified hex world problem from exercise 21.1. Compute alpha


vectors for each action using the blind lower bound. Then, using the alpha vectors, compute


the value at the belief
