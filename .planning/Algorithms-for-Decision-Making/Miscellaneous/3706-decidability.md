# Decidability

_Source page: 601_



An


undecidable


problem cannot always be solved in finite time. Perhaps one of


the most famous undecidable problems is the


halting problem


, which involves


The technical requirement is that


taking any program written in a sufficiently expressive language


as input and


the language is


Turing complete


or


deciding whether it will terminate. It was proved that there is no algorithm that


computationally universal


, meaning


can perform such an analysis in general. Although algorithms exist that can


that it can be used to simulate any


Turing machine.


correctly determine whether some programs terminate, there is no algorithm that


can determine whether any arbitrary program will terminate.
