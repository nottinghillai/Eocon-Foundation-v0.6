A conditional probability distribution over discrete variables can be represented


using a table. In fact, we can use the same discrete factor representation that


we used in section 2.3.1 for joint distributions. Table 2.3 shows an example of a


table representing


with all binary variables. In contrast with a joint


table (e.g., table 2.1), the column containing the probabilities need not sum to


Table 2.3. An example of a condi-
