# state uncertainty

_Source page: 399_



Previous chapters have included uncertainty in the transition function, in terms


of the uncertainty both in the resulting state and in the model. In this part, we


extend uncertainty to include the state. Instead of observing the state exactly, we


receive observations that have only a probabilistic relationship with the state.


Such problems can be modeled as a


partially observable Markov decision process
