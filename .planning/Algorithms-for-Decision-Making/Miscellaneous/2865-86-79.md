Exercise 21.3.


What is the complexity of a backup at a single belief point in point-based


value iteration assuming that


Solution:


In the process of doing a backup, we compute an


and


for every action

that maximizes


Update


. A belief update, as shown in equation (19.7), is


|S|


because it iterates over all initial and successor states. Hence, computing
