Nonlinear utility functions can be obtained when using linear regression when


combined with an appropriate selection of nonlinear basis functions.


Neural network regression relieves us of having to specify basis functions, but


fitting them is more complex and generally requires us to use gradient descent


to tune our parametric approximation of the value function.
