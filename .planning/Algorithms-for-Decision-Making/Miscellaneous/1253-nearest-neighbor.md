# Nearest Neighbor

_Source page: 185_



A simple approach to local approximation is to use the value of the state in


that is the


nearest neighbor


of


. In order to use this approach, we need a


distance


metric


(see appendix A.3). We use


to denote the distance between two


states


and


. The approximate value function is then
