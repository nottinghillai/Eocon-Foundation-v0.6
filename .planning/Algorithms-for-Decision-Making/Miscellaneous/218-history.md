The theory of automating the process of decision making has its roots in the


dreams of early philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, and writers. The ancient


Greeks began incorporating automation into myths and stories as early as 800 BC.


The word

was first used in Homer’s

industry led to the development of the automatic loom, which in turn laid the

originated in the Czech writer Karel Čapek’s play titled

, about machines that could perform


work that humans would prefer not to do. The play inspired other science fiction


writers to incorporate robots into their writing. In the mid-twentieth century, the


notable writer and professor Isaac Asimov laid out his vision for robotics in his


famous

series.


A major challenge in practical implementations of automated decision making


is accounting for uncertainty. Even at the end of the twentieth century, George


Dantzig, most famous for developing the simplex algorithm, stated in 1991:

chapter 1. introduction


In retrospect it is interesting to note that the original problem that started my research


is still outstanding—namely the problem of planning or scheduling dynamically


over time, particularly planning dynamically under uncertainty. If such a problem


could be successfully solved it could (eventually through better planning) contribute

While decision making under uncertainty still remains an active area of research,


over the past few centuries, researchers and engineers have come closer to mak-


ing the concepts posed by these early dreamers possible. Current state-of-the-art


decision-making algorithms rely on a convergence of concepts developed in multi-


ple disciplines, including economics, psychology, neuroscience, computer science,


engineering, mathematics, and operations research. This section highlights some


major contributions from these disciplines. The cross-pollination between disci-


plines has led to many recent advances and will likely continue to support growth


in the future.
