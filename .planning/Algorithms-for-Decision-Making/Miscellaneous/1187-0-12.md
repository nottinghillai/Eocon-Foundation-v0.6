Exercise 7.5.


Suppose that we have a three-tile, straight-line hex world (appendix F.1)


where the rightmost tile is an absorbing state. When we take any action in the rightmost


state, we get a reward of


10


and we are transported to a fourth terminal state where we no


longer receive any reward. Use a discount factor of


0.9


, and perform a single step of


policy iteration where the initial policy


has us move east in the first tile, northeast in the


second tile, and southwest in the third tile. For the policy evaluation step, write out the


transition matrix


and the reward vector


, and then solve the infinite horizon value


function


directly using matrix inversion. For the policy improvement step, compute


the updated policy


by maximizing the lookahead equation.


Solution:


For the policy evaluation step, we use equation (7.10), repeated here:
