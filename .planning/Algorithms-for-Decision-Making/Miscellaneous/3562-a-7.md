appendix a. mathematical concepts


The unit of information content depends on the base of the logarithm. We


generally assume natural logarithms (with base


), making the unit


nat


, which is


short for


natural


. In information theoretic contexts, the base is often


, making the


unit


bit


. We can think of this quantity as the number of bits required to transmit


the value


according to an optimal message encoding when the distribution over


messages follows the specified distribution.
