). A common approach to solving POMDPs involves


inferring a belief distribution over the underlying state at the current time step and


then applying a policy that maps beliefs to actions. This part begins by discussing


how to update our belief distribution, given a past sequence of observations and


actions. It then discusses a variety of exact and approximate methods for solving


POMDPs.
