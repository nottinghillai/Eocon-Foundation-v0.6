Example 27.2.


Heuristic search


Consider the collaborative predator-prey problem shown at right. We apply


exploration and conditional plan


heuristic search to a depth of


, with three policies retained at each


expansion for the collaborative


predator-prey hex world problem


iteration. After iteration


, the policies are


shown here. The predators are red


and green. The prey is blue.

At the next iteration


, heuristic search again starts at the initial belief


and takes


steps following the heuristic exploration. The


explored beliefs used to select the next three conditional plans are
