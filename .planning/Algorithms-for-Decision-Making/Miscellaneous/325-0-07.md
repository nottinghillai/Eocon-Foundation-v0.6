parameters to specify the joint distribution. This exponential growth in the num-


ber of parameters makes storing the distribution in memory difficult. In some


cases, we can assume that our variables are


independent


, which means that the


realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other. If


and


are independent, which is sometimes written as


, then we know that

in table 2.1 are independent, we can
