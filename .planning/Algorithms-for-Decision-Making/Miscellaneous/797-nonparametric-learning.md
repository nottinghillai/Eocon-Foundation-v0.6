# Nonparametric Learning

_Source page: 104_



The previous two sections assumed that the probabilistic model was of a fixed


form and that a fixed set of parameters were to be learned from the data. An


alternative approach is based on


nonparametric


methods in which the number of


parameters scales with the amount of data. A common nonparametric method is


kernel density estimation


(algorithm 4.3). Given observations


, kernel density


1:


estimation represents the density as follows:
