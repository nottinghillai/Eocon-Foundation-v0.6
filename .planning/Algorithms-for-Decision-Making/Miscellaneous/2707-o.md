Solution:


Recall that there are


|A|


possible


-step plans. Exponential growth


) is faster than polynomial growth (


), and we have better-than exponential growth


in


|O|


and polynomial growth in


|A|


. The number of plans thus increases faster with


respect to the number of observations. To demonstrate, let us use


|A|


|O|


, and


as a baseline. The baseline has
