_Source page: 351_



We can formulate the problem of acting optimally in an MDP with an unknown


model as a higher-dimensional MDP with a known model. This MDP is known as


Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process


, which is related to the partially observable


Markov decision process discussed in part IV.


The state space in the Bayes-adaptive MDP is the Cartesian product
