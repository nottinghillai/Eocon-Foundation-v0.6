Now, we marginalize over all successors


and observations


. Because of the transition


and observation independence, we can freely condition the distributions on these other


non-


state and observation factors, which is the same as conditioning on


and


. We can


then apply the definition of transition and observation independence. Finally, we can move


the summation in and recognize


results:
