In the mid-twentieth century, computer scientists began formulating the problem


of intelligent decision making as a problem of symbolic manipulation through


formal logic. The computer program Logic Theorist, written in the mid-twentieth


century to perform automated reasoning, used this way of thinking to prove math-


ematical theorems. Herbert Simon, one of its inventors, addressed the symbolic


nature of the program by relating it to the human mind:


We invented a computer program capable of thinking nonnumerically, and thereby


solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of

These symbolic systems relied heavily on human expertise. An alternative ap-


proach to intelligence, called


connectionism


, was inspired in part by developments


in neuroscience and focuses on the use of artificial neural networks as a substrate


for intelligence. With the knowledge that neural networks could be trained for


pattern recognition, connectionists attempt to learn intelligent behavior from data


or experience rather than the hard-coded knowledge of experts. The connection-


ist paradigm underpinned the success of AlphaGo, the autonomous program


that beat a human professional at the game of Go, as well as much of the devel-


opment of autonomous vehicles. Algorithms that combine both symbolic and


connectionist paradigms remain an active area of research today.
