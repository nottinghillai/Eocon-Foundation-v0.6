Exercise 4.1.


Suppose that Anna is shooting basketball free throws. Before we see her


play, we start with an independent uniform prior over the probability that she successfully


makes a basket per shot. We observe her take three shots, with two of them resulting in


successful baskets. What is the probability that we assign to her making the next basket?
