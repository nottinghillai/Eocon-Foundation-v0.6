true


Hence, the formula is satisfiable. Although a satisfying assignment can be


easily found for some 3SAT problems, sometimes just by quick inspection,


they are difficult to solve in general. One way to determine whether a satisfy-


ing assignment can be made is to enumerate the


possible truth values of


all the variables. Although determining whether a satisfying truth assign-


ment exists is difficult, verification of whether a truth assignment leads to


satisfaction can be done in linear time.
