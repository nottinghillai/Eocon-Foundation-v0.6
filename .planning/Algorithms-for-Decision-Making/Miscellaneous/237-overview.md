# Overview

_Source page: 36_



This book is divided into five parts. The first part addresses the problem of


reasoning about uncertainty and objectives in simple decisions at a single point


in time. The second extends decision making to sequential problems, where we


must make a sequence of decisions in response to information about the outcomes


of our actions as we proceed. The third addresses model uncertainty, where we


do not start with a known model and must learn how to act through interaction


with the environment. The fourth addresses state uncertainty, where imperfect


perceptual information prevents us from knowing the full environmental state.


The final part discusses decision contexts involving multiple agents.
