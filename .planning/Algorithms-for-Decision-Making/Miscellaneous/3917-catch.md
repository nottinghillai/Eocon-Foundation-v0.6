# Catch

_Source page: 641_



In the


catch problem


, Johnny would like to successfully catch throws from his


father, and he prefers catching longer-distance throws. However, he is uncertain


about the relationship between the distances of a throw and the probability of


a successful catch. He does know that the probability of a successful catch is


the same, regardless of whether he is throwing or catching; and he has a finite


number of attempted catches to maximize his expected utility before he has to go


home.
