conditional Gaussian


model can be used to represent a distribution over a con-


tinuous variable given one or more discrete variables. For example, if we have a


continuous variable


and a discrete variable


with values


1 :


, we can define a

This definition is for a mixture of


conditional Gaussian model as follows:


univariate Gaussians, but the con-


if


cept can be easily generalized to a


mixture of multidimensional Gaus-
