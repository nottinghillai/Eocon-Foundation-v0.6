Trajectories are colored according to the action. In the first iteration, the


agent behaves randomly, unable to make progress toward the goal (

). With additional iterations, the agent learns to mimic the expert policy


of accelerating in the direction of travel. This behavior is apparent in the


new trajectories, which spiral outward, and the policy, which assigns high
