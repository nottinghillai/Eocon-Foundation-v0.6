Exercise 9.6.


Will changing the ordering of the action space cause forward search to take


different actions? Will changing the ordering of the action space cause branch and bound


to take different actions? Can the ordering of the action space affect how many states are


visited by branch and bound?


Solution:


Forward search enumerates over all possible future actions. It may return different


actions if there are ties in their expected utilities. Branch and bound maintains the same


optimality guarantee over the horizon as forward search by sorting by upper bound. The


ordering of the action space can affect branch and bound’s visitation rate when the upper


bound produces the same expected value for two or more actions. Below we show this


effect on the modified mountain car problem from example 9.2. The plot compares the


number of states visited in forward search to that of branch and bound for different action


orderings to depth


. Branch and bound consistently visits far fewer states than forward


search, but action ordering can still affect state visitation.
