Exercise 11.5.


Our implementation of the regression gradient (algorithm 11.3) fits a


linear mapping from perturbations to the difference in returns,


. We


evaluate


and


for each of the


perturbations, thus reevaluating


a total of


times. How might we reallocate the samples in a more effective manner?

chapter 11. policy gradient estimation


Solution:


One approach is to evaluate


once and use the same value for each perturba-


tion, thereby conducting only


evaluations. Having an accurate estimate of


is


particularly important for an accurate regression gradient estimate. An alternative is to


still compute


once, but use


rollouts, thus preserving the total number of rollouts


per iteration. This approach uses the same amount of computation as algorithm 11.3, but


it can produce a more reliable gradient estimate.
