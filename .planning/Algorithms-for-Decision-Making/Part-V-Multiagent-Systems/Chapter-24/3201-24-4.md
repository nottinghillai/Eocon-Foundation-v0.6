As


, the agent is insensitive to differences in utility, and selects actions


uniformly at random. As


, the policy converges to a deterministic best


response. We can treat


as a parameter that can be learned from data using,


for example, maximum likelihood estimation (section 4.1). This learning-based


approach aims to be predictive of behavior rather than prescriptive of behav-


ior, though having a predictive model of other human agents can be useful in


building a system that prescribes optimal behavior. Algorithm 24.4 provides an


implementation of a softmax response.
