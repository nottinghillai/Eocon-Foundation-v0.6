slightly different way to compute a


belief backup, though the result is


the same.


The algorithm maintains a lower bound on the optimal value function,


for all


. We initialize our alpha vectors to start with a lower bound and


then perform a


backup


to update the alpha vectors at each point in


. The backup


operation (algorithm 21.6) takes a belief


and a set of alpha vectors


and


constructs a new alpha vector. The algorithm iterates through every possible


action


and observation


and extracts the alpha vector from


that is maximal at


the resulting belief state:


arg max
