An instance of updating discrete beliefs is given in example 19.3, and the


belief update is implemented in algorithm 19.2. The success of the belief update


depends on having accurate observation and transition models. In cases where


these models are not well known, it is generally advisable to use simplified models


with more diffuse distributions to help prevent overconfidence, which leads to


brittleness in the state estimates.
