Probability models could include, for example, the categorical distributions or


Gaussian distributions mentioned in earlier chapters.


The other challenge is performing the maximization in equation (4.1). For


many common probability models, we can perform this optimization analytically.


Others may be difficult. A common approach is to maximize the


log-likelihood


often denoted as


. Since the log-transformation is monotonically increasing,


Although it does not matter


maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood:


whether we maximize the natural


logarithm (base


) or the common


arg max
