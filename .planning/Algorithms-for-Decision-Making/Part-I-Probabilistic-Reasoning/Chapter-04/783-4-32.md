As we have seen, Bayesian parameter estimation is straightforward for binary


and discrete random variables because it involves simply counting the various


outcomes in the data. Bayes’ rule can be used to infer the distribution over the


parameters for other parametric distributions. Depending on the choice of prior


and the form of the parametric distribution, calculating the posterior over the


space of parameters also might be done analytically.
