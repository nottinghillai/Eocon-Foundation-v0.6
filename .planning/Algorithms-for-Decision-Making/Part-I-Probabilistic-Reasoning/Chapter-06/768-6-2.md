Conveniently, if a beta distribution is used as a prior over a parameter of a


binary distribution, then the posterior is also a beta distribution. In particular,


if the prior is given by


Beta


and we make an observation


, then we get a


posterior of


Beta


1,


if


and


Beta


if


. Hence, if we started


with a prior given by


Beta


and our data showed that there were


collisions


out of


flights, then the posterior would be given by


Beta


. The


and


parameters in the prior are sometimes called


pseudocounts


because they


are treated similarly to the observed counts of the two outcome classes in the


posterior, although the pseudocounts need not be integers.


Choosing the prior, in principle, should be done without knowledge of the


data used to compute the posterior. Uniform priors often work well in practice,


although if expert knowledge is available, then it can be encoded into the prior.


For example, suppose that we had a slightly bent coin and we wanted to estimate


, the probability that the coin would land heads. Before we collected any data


by flipping the coin, we would start with a belief


that is likely to be around

. Instead of starting with a uniform prior
