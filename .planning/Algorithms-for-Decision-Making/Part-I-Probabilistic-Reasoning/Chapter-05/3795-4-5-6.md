Many graph search algorithms conduct a search from an initial state and fan


out from there. In so doing, these algorithms trace out a


search tree


. The initial


state is the root node, and any time we transition from


to


during search, an


edge from


to a new node


is added to the search tree. A search tree for the


same sliding tile puzzle is shown in figure E.2.
