Figure 8.11 shows the simplexes obtained for the unit cube.


Simplex interpolation first translates and scales a state vector


to the unit


hypercube of its corresponding cell to obtain


. It then sorts the entries in


to


determine which simplex contains


. The utility at


can then be expressed by a
