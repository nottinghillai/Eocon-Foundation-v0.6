, shown in blue in figure 21.11.


The utility at


with that alpha vector is


0.5


. However,


) =


, showing that backing


up a belief can result in an alpha vector that represents a lower utility at that belief.


This fact motivates the use of the if statement in randomized point-based value iteration


(algorithm 21.8). That if statement will use either the alpha vector from the backup or the


dominating alpha vector in


at belief


, whichever gives the greatest utility estimate.
