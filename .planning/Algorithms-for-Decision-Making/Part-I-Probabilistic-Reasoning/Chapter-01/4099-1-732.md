The double-colon operator can be used to specify the type for any field:


struct


::


Int64


::


Float64


end


These type annotations require that we pass in an


Int64


for the first field and


Float64


for the second field. For compactness, this book does not use type


annotations, but it is at the expense of performance. Type annotations allow


Julia to improve runtime performance because the compiler can optimize the


Any


underlying code for specific types.


Number

Real
