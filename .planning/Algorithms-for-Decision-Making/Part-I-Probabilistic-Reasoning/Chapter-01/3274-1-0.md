Exercise 24.3.


Given a stationary joint policy


that is a Nash equilibrium for a simple


game with a horizon of


, prove that it is also a Nash equilibrium for the same simple


game repeated to any finite or infinite horizon.


Solution:


By definition of a Nash equilibrium, all agents


are performing a best response


to all other policies


following equation (24.2):


By definition of


, we have


) =


The joint policy remains constant over time for all agents. Apply any horizon


, with


any discount factor (


for


for


). The utility of agent


after


steps


is

The discount factor becomes a constant multiplier


. Therefore, any constant multi-


plication of equation (24.2) on both sides results in the same inequality, completing the


proof:


Exercise 24.4.


Prove that a Nash equilibrium is a correlated equilibrium.


Solution:


Consider any uncorrelated joint policy


. For any agent


) =
