What is the discount factor

) =


Solution:


The optimal value of


is associated with following the optimal policy


starting from


. Given the transition model, the optimal policy from


is to continue until


reaching


, which is a terminal state where we can no longer transition to another state or


accumulate additional reward. Thus, the optimal value of


can be computed as
