is used to represent that the left side is propor-


tional to the right side. Example 3.4 illustrates how inference can be applied to


classifying radar tracks.


We can use this method to infer a distribution over classes, but for many


applications, we have to commit to a particular class. It is common to classify


according to the class with the highest posterior probability,

However, choosing a class is really a decision problem that often should take into


account the consequences of misclassification. For example, if we are interested in


using our classifier to filter out targets that are not aircraft for the purpose of air


traffic control, then we can afford to occasionally let a few birds and other clutter


tracks through our filter. However, we would want to avoid filtering out any real


aircraft because that could lead to a collision. In this case, we would probably


want to classify a track as a bird only if the posterior probability were close to 1.


Decision problems will be discussed in chapter 6.
