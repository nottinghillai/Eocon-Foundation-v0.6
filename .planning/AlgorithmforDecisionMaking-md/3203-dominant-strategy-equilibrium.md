# Dominant Strategy Equilibrium

_Source page: 519_



In some games, an agent has a


dominant strategy


, which is a policy that is a best


response against all other possible agent policies. For example, in the prisoner’s


dilemma (example 24.1), the best response of agent


is to defect regardless of


the policy of agent


, making defect a dominant strategy for agent


. A joint

. In the prisoner’s dilemma, a joint policy where both agents defect is a


own utility function results in a


dominant strategy equilibrium.


Many games do not have a dominant strategy
