There are many methods for designing decision-making agents. Depending on


the application, some may be more appropriate than others. They differ in the


responsibilities of the designer and the tasks left to automation. This section


briefly overviews a collection of these methods. The book will focus primarily


on planning and reinforcement learning, but some of the techniques will involve


elements of supervised learning and optimization.
