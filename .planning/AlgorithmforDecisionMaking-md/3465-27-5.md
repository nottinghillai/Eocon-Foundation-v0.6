proved further by performing dy-


namic programming.


with ties favoring the current policy. This process can terminate when agents stop


changing their policies.


While this algorithm is fast and guaranteed to converge, it does not always find


the best joint policy. It relies on iterated best response to find a Nash equilibrium,


but there may be many Nash equilibria, with different utilities associated with


them. This approach will find only one of them.
