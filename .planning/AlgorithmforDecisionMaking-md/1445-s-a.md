Exercise 9.5.


Building on the previous exercise, suppose now that we want to keep all the


original actions in our action space and only re-discretize the state space. What would the


size of the new state space need to be to make the computational complexity of forward


search approximately depth-invariant with respect to the size of our original state and


action spaces?


Solution:


The computational complexity of forward search is given by
