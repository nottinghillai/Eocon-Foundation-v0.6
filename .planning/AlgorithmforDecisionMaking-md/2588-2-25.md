Solution:


Since we have a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and we are given


we need to compute


sigma points. We need to compute the square-root matrix


, such that


BB


= (


. Since the scaled covariance matrix is diagonal,


the square-root matrix is simply the elementwise square root of
