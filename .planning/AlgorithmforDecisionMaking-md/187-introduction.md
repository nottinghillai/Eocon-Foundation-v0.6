# Introduction

_Source page: 23_



Many important problems involve decision making under uncertainty, including


aircraft collision avoidance, wildfire management, and disaster response. When


designing automated decision-making systems or decision-support systems, it is


important to account for various sources of uncertainty while carefully balanc-


ing multiple objectives. We will discuss these challenges from a computational


perspective, aiming to provide the theory behind decision-making models and


computational approaches. This chapter introduces the problem of decision mak-


ing under uncertainty, provides some examples of applications, and outlines


the space of computational approaches. It then summarizes how various disci-


plines have contributed to our understanding of intelligent decision making and


highlights areas of potential societal impact. We conclude with an outline of the


remainder of the book.
