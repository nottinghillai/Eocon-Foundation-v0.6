Iterations proceed left to right and top to bottom. Each blue dot represents


a particle in the particle filter, corresponding to a partial belief in being in


that location of the grid.

Beliefs for POMDPs with discrete state spaces can be represented using cate-


gorical distributions and can be updated analytically.


Beliefs for linear Gaussian POMDPs can be represented using Gaussian distri-


butions and can also be updated analytically.


Beliefs for nonlinear, continuous POMDPs can also be represented using Gaus-


sian distributions, but they cannot typically be updated analytically. In this


case, the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter can be used.


Continuous problems can sometimes be modeled under the assumption that


they are linear Gaussian.


• Particle filters approximate the belief with a large collection of state particles.
