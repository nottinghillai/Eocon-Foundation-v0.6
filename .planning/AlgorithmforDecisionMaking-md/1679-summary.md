# Summary

_Source page: 267_



• A gradient can be estimated using finite differences.


Linear regression can also be used to provide more robust estimates of the


policy gradient.


The likelihood ratio can be used to derive a form of the policy gradient that


does not depend on the transition model for stochastic policies.


The variance of the policy gradient can be significantly reduced using the


reward-to-go and baseline subtraction.
