tion, throughout this book we will


use


log


to mean the logarithm


Computing the sum of log-likelihoods is typically much more numerically stable


of


with base


compared to computing the product of many small probability masses or densities.


The remainder of this section will demonstrate how to optimize equation (4.1)


for different types of distributions.
