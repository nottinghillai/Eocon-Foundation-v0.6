(all actions are equally desirable)


Exercise 7.6.


Perform two steps of value iteration to the problem in exercise 7.5, starting


with an initial value function


) =


for all


Solution:


We need to use the Bellman backup (equation (7.16)) to iteratively update the


value function. The actions in the


max


term correspond to


, and


NE


NW


SW


SE


For our first iteration, the value function is zero for all states, so we only need to consider


the reward component:


) =


max
