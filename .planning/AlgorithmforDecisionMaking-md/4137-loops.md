# Loops

_Source page: 666_



loop


allows for repeated evaluation of expressions. One type of loop is the


while loop, which repeatedly evaluates a block of expressions until the specified


condition after the


while


keyword is met. The following example sums the values


in the array


11


13


16


18


while


isempty


+=


pop!


end


Another type of loop is the for loop, which uses the


for


keyword. The following


example will also sum over the values in the array


but will not modify


11


13


16


18


for


in


+=


end


The


in


keyword can be replaced by


or


. The following code block is equivalent:


11


13


16


18


for


length


+=


end
