# Planning

_Source page: 28_



Planning


is a form of optimization that uses a model of the problem dynamics


to help guide the search. A broad base of literature explores various planning


problems, much of it focused on deterministic problems. For some problems,


it may be acceptable to approximate the dynamics with a deterministic model.


Assuming a deterministic model allows us to use methods that can more easily


scale to high-dimensional problems. For other problems, accounting for future


uncertainty is critical. This book focuses entirely on problems in which accounting


for uncertainty is important.
