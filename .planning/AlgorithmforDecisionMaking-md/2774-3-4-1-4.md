21.5. randomized point-based value iteration

Each update takes a set of alpha vectors


as input and outputs a set of alpha


vectors


that improve on the value function represented by


at the beliefs in


In other words, it outputs

. We begin


by initializing

. We then remove a point


randomly from


and perform a belief backup (algorithm 21.6) on


, using


to get a new alpha vector,


. We then find the alpha vector in
