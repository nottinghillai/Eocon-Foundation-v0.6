# Inference

_Source page: 65_



The previous chapter explained how to represent probability distributions. This


chapter will show how to use these probabilistic representations for


inference


which involves determining the distribution over one or more unobserved vari-


ables given the values associated with a set of observed variables. It begins by


introducing exact inference methods. Because exact inference can be computation-


ally intractable depending on the structure of the network, we will also discuss


several algorithms for approximate inference.
