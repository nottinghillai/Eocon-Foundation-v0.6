that best achieves its objectives


We focus here on discrete time


in the presence of various sources of uncertainty,


including the following:


problems. Continuous time prob-


lems are studied in the field of


outcome uncertainty


, where the effects of our actions are uncertain,


control theory

model uncertainty


, where our model of the problem is uncertain,

state uncertainty


, where the true state of the environment is uncertain, and


interaction uncertainty


, where the behavior of the other agents interacting in the


environment is uncertain.


This book is organized around these four sources of uncertainty. Making decisions


A comprehensive introduction to
