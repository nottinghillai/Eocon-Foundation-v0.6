The first two constraints ensure that


is a categorical distribution, and the final


set of constraints ensures that we find a belief vector for which


has a higher


expected reward than all alpha vectors in


. If, after solving the linear program,


the utility gap


is negative, then


is dominated. If


is positive, then


is not


dominated and


is a belief at which


is not dominated. Algorithm 20.6 provides


an implementation for solving equation (20.16) to determine a belief, if one exists,


where


is most positive.
