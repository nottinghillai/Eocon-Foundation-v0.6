, and


produce a new vector of feature expectations. Figure 18.2 illustrates this margin


maximization process.


We iterate until the margin is sufficiently small, with


. At convergence,


we can solve for a mixed policy that attempts to have feature expectations as close


as possible to that of the expert policy:


minimize
