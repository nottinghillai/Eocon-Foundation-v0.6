Suppose that strategy


results


in a reward of


per time step and


The sum of rewards is sometimes called the


return


strategy


results in a reward of


100


In an


infinite horizon


problem in which the number of decisions is unbounded,


per time step. Intuitively, a rational


agent should prefer strategy


over


the sum of rewards can become infinite.


There are several ways to define utility


strategy


, but both provide the


in terms of individual rewards in infinite horizon problems. One way is to impose


same infinite expected utility.
