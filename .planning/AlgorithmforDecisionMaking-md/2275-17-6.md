Algorithm 17.1 provides an implementation of this. An example of several learning


rates is shown in example 17.1.


The update rule discussed here will appear again in later sections and is related


to stochastic gradient descent. The magnitude of the update is proportional to the


difference between the sample and the previous estimate. The difference between


the sample and previous estimate is called the


temporal difference error
