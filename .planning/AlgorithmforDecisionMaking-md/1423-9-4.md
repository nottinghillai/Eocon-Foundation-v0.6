subject to

where


is a deterministic transition function that


is the current state and


returns the state that results from taking action


from state


. A common strategy


for producing a suitable deterministic transition function from a stochastic transi-


tion function is to use the most likely transition. If the dynamics in equation (9.4)


are linear and the reward function is convex, then the problem is convex.


Example 9.10 provides an instance involving navigating to a goal state while


avoiding an obstacle and minimizing acceleration effort. Both the state space and


action space are continuous, and we can find a solution in well under a second.


Replanning after every step can help compensate for stochasticity or unexpected


events. For example, if the obstacle moves, we can readjust our plan, as illustrated


in figure 9.9.
