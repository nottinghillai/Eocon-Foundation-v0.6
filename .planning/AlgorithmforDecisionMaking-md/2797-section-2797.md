. The


linear interpolation from

the tooth. To combine multiple teeth and form the upper bound, we take the


minimum interpolated value at any belief, creating the distinctive sawtooth shape.


As is apparent in figure 21.6, the sawtooth upper bound is a piecewise linear


function, but it is not convex, in contrast with the alpha vector representations

discussed earlier in this chapter.

We can entend the intuition from the two-state case to allow us to compute the
