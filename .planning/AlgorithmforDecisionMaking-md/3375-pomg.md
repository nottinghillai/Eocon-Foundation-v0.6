Consider a multiagent POMG generalization of the crying baby problem.


crying baby problem as a POMG.


We have two caregivers taking care of a baby. As in the POMDP version, the


Appendix F.14 provides additional

states are the baby being hungry or sated. Each caregiver’s actions are to feed,


sing, or ignore the baby. If both caregivers choose to perform the same action,


the cost is halved. For example, if both caregivers feed the baby, then the


reward is only


2.5


instead of


. However, the caregivers do not perfectly


observe the state of the baby. Instead, they rely on the noisy observations


of the baby crying, both with the same observation. As a consequence of


the reward structure, there is a trade-off between helping each other and


greedily choosing a less costly action.
