All the components on the right side are specified in the conditional probability


distributions associated with the nodes in the Bayesian network. We can com-


pute the denominator in equation (3.1) using the same approach, but with an


additional summation over the values for


This process of using the definition of conditional probability, marginaliza-


tion, and applying the chain rule can be used to perform exact inference in any


Bayesian network. We can implement exact inference using factors. Recall that


factors represent discrete multivariate distributions. We use the following three


operations on factors to achieve this:


We use the


factor product


(algorithm 3.1) to combine two factors to produce a


larger factor whose scope is the combined scope of the input factors. If we have
