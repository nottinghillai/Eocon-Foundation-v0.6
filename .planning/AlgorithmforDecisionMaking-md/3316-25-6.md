. Algorithm 25.4 provides an implementation. This


approach can be used to generate hierarchical softmax solutions (section 24.7).


In fact, we can use algorithm 24.9 directly.

Because we assume that policies


are


stationary


, in that they do not


vary over time, the Nash equilibria


covered here are


stationary Markov


perfect equilibria
