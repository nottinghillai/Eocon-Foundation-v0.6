otherwise.


However, in many applications, we may not want to have such a hard threshold


that results in assigning zero probability to


for certain values of


Instead of a hard threshold, we could use a


soft threshold


, which assigns low


probabilities when below a threshold and high probabilities when above a thresh-


old. One way to represent a soft threshold is to use a


logit model


, which produces


a sigmoid curve:
