. What belief


maximizes the


utility gap


, as defined by the linear program in equation (20.16)?


Solution:


The alpha vectors in


are shown in blue and the alpha vector


is shown in red.


We care only about the region where


0.3


0.7


, where


dominates the alpha vectors


in


; in other words, where the red line is above the blue lines. The point where the gap


between the red line and the maximum of the blue lines occurs at


0.5


, with a gap of


0.2


. Hence, the belief that maximizes this gap is


= [
