until we have an improvement in our objective with


and our


constraint is met with


. The step factor


shrinks the distance


between


and


at each iteration, with


typically set to


0.5


Algorithm 12.5 provides an implementation of this approach. Figure 12.4


illustrates the relationship between the feasible regions associated with the natural


gradient and the line search. Figure 12.5 demonstrates the approach on a regulator


problem, and example 12.1 shows an update for a simple problem.
