# Optimization

_Source page: 28_



Another approach is for the designer to specify the space of possible decision


strategies and a performance measure to be maximized. Evaluating the perfor-


mance of a decision strategy generally involves running a batch of simulations.


The optimization algorithm then performs a search in this space for the optimal


strategy. If the space is relatively small and the performance measure does not


have many local optima, then various local or global search methods may be


appropriate. Although knowledge of a dynamic model is generally assumed to


run the simulations, it is not otherwise used to guide the search, which can be


important for complex problems.
