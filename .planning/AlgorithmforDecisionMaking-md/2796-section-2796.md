The walls of each pyramid can be defined by hyperplanes. The combination of


multiple pyramids forms the


-dimensional sawtooth. The sawtooth upper bound


at any belief is the minimum value among these pyramids at that belief.

21.6. sawtooth upper bound


437


Consider the sawtooth representation in a two-state POMDP, such as in the


crying baby problem as shown in figure 21.6. The corners of each tooth are the


values


and


for each standard basis belief


. The sharp lower point


of each tooth is the value


, since each tooth is a point-set pair
