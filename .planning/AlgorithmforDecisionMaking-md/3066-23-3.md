Algorithm 23.2. An algorithm for


function


utility


::


ControllerPolicy


performing iterative policy evalu-


ation to compute the utility of a fi-


nite state controller


with


k_max


iterations. The utility function per-


U′


s′


sum

for

forms a single-step evaluation for


U′

the current controller node


and

following equation (23.1).


end


This algorithm was adapted from


algorithm 7.3, which applies itera-
