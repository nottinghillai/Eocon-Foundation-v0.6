# |O|−

_Source page: 566_



Solution:


Recall that there are


|A|


possible


-step single-agent conditional


plans. We can construct a joint policy of conditional plans using every combination of these


single-agent conditional plans across agents. The number of


-step multiagent conditional


plans is


|O


|O


|−


|A


∈I


Exercise 26.5.


Define the best response for a POMG in terms of an agent


’s utilities


Propose the iterated best response for POMGs.


Solution:


The best response


of agent


to other agents’ policies


is defined following


equation (24.2) for an initial belief


with any other policy


. For conditional plans,


is defined by equations (26.1)


and (26.2).


The implementation of iterated best response follows from section 24.2.1. First, the


conditional plans and simple game can be created, as in algorithm 26.3. Then, we can


iterate best response using algorithm 24.8.
