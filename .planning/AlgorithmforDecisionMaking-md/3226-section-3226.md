Any deviation from this results in one agent gaining utility and the other


losing utility. This is a correlated equilibrium for rock-paper-scissors.

Although linear programs can be solved in polynomial time, the size of the joint


action space grows exponentially with the number of agents. The constraints


enforce a correlated equilibrium. The objective, however, can be used to select


among different valid correlated equilibria. Table 24.1 provides several common


choices for the objective function.
