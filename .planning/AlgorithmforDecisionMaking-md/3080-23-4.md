Existing nodes can be pruned as well. Whenever a new node dominates an


existing node, we prune the existing node from the controller. Any transitions


to the deleted node are instead rerouted to the dominating node. This process is


identical to pruning the new node instead and updating the dominated node’s


action and successor links to those of the new node. Example 23.4 demonstrates


evaluation, expansion, and pruning on the crying baby problem.
