# Continuous Joint Distributions

_Source page: 49_



We can also define joint distributions over continuous variables. A rather simple


distribution is the


multivariate uniform distribution


, which assigns a constant prob-


ability density everywhere there is support. We can use


to represent a


uniform distribution over a


box


, which is a Cartesian product of intervals, with


the


th interval being


. This family of uniform distributions is a special type


of


multivariate product distribution


, which is a distribution defined in terms of the


product of univariate distributions. In this case,
