Exercise 17.2.


Following the previous exercise, suppose that once we have estimated


the mean with five samples for both methods, we are provided with a single additional


sample,


, that we will use as the final sample in estimating our mean. Which of the


two incremental estimation methods (i.e.,


0.1


or


0.5


) would be preferable?


Solution:


While we do not know what the sample would be or what the underlying mean


of the process is, we would likely prefer the second incrementally estimated mean that


uses


0.5


. Since we only have one sample left, the first learning rate is too small


to considerably change the mean, while the second learning rate is large enough to be


responsive, without neglecting the past samples. Consider two cases:


1.


If we assume that the next sample is approximately equal to the


incremental


mean of all


previous samples, then we have


. Thus, performing an incremental update of


the mean yields no change to our estimate. We have
