).


MMDPs and MPOMDPs can also result when there is transition, observation,


and reward independence. Any MDP or POMDP algorithm discussed in earlier


chapters can be applied to solve these problems.


Table 27.2 summarizes some of these subclasses. Figure 27.2 illustrates the


relationships among the models discussed in this book.
