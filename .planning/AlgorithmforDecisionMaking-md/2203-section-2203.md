. For general values for


and


, we would have


tally marks and


plus signs. Given that many tally marks and plus signs, we can


arrange them in any order we want. We can represent a solution as a string of


characters, where a character is either


or


, with


of those characters being


. To obtain


the number of solutions, we count the number of ways we can choose


positions for


from the set of


positions, resulting in


solutions. The number of belief states is this expression summed for


from
