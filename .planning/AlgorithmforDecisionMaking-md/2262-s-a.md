Dirichlet distributions. Each Dirichlet


is specified using


|S|


independent parameters. In total, we have


|S|


|A|


independent


parameters.


Exercise 16.4.


Consider the problem statement in exercise 16.1, but this time we want to


use Bayesian reinforcement learning with a prior distribution represented by a Dirichlet


distribution. Assuming a uniform prior, what is the posterior distribution over the next


state, given that we are in state


and take action


Solution:


Dir
