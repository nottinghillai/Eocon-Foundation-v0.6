21.5. randomized point-based value iteration


433


Repeated application of the backup operation over the beliefs in


gradually


increases the lower bound on the value function represented by the alpha vectors


until convergence. The converged value function will not necessarily be optimal


because


typically does not include all beliefs reachable from the initial belief.


However, so long as the beliefs in


are well distributed across the reachable belief


space, the approximation may be acceptable. In any case, the resulting value


function is guaranteed to provide a lower bound that can be used with other


algorithms, potentially online, to further improve the policy.


Point-based value iteration is implemented in algorithm 21.7. Figure 21.4 shows


several iterations on an example problem.
