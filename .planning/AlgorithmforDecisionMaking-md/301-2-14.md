Appendix B shows plots of Gaussian density functions with different parameters.


Although a Gaussian distribution is often convenient because it is defined by


only two parameters and makes computation and derivation easy, it has some


limitations. It assigns nonzero probability to large positive and negative values,


which may not be appropriate for the quantity we are trying to model. For example,


we might not want to assign nonzero probabilities for aircraft flying below the


ground or at infeasible altitudes. We can use a


truncated Gaussian distribution


(see

of possible values; that is, the range of values
