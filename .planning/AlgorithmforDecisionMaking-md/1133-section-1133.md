Updating the value at a single state requires summing over all


|S|


states. For a single


iteration over all states, we must do this operation


|S|


times. Thus, the time complexity of


steps of iterative policy evaluation is

Exercise 7.4.


Suppose that we have an MDP with six states,


, and four actions,


1:6


1:4


Using the following tabular form of the action value function


, compute
