# Imitation Learning

_Source page: 377_



Previous chapters have assumed either that a reward function is known or that re-


wards are received while interacting with the environment. For some applications,


it may be easier for an expert to demonstrate the desired behavior rather than


specify a reward function. This chapter discusses algorithms for


imitation learning


where the desired behavior is learned from expert demonstration. We will cover


a variety of methods ranging from very simple likelihood-maximization methods


Additional methods and applica-


to more complicated iterative methods that involve reinforcement learning.
