Algorithm 15.2 provides an implementation of this. Example 15.1 illustrates how


to compute these posterior distributions from counts of wins and losses.

is one that maximizes our expected immediate reward—or, in


other words, the posterior probability of winning in the context of our binary


bandit problem. There may be multiple greedy actions. We do not always want to


select a greedy action because we may miss out on discovering another action that


may actually provide higher reward in expectation. We can use the information


from the beta distributions associated with the different actions to drive our


exploration of nongreedy actions.
