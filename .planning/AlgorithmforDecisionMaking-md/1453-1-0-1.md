Exercise 9.7.


Is sparse sampling with


|S|


equivalent to forward search?


Solution:


No. While the computational complexities are identical at


|S|


|A|


, forward


search will branch on all states in the state space, while sparse sampling will branch on


|S|


randomly sampled states.


Exercise 9.8.


Given an MDP with


|S|


10


|A|


, and a uniform transition distribution


) =


1/


|S|


for all


and


, what is the probability that sparse sampling with


|S|


samples and depth


yields the exact same search tree produced by forward


search with depth


Solution:


For both forward search and sparse sampling, we branch on all actions from


the current state node. For forward search, at each of these action nodes, we branch on


all states, while for sparse sampling, we will branch on


|S|


sampled states. If these


sampled states are exactly equal to the state space, that action branch is equivalent to the


branch produced in forward search. Thus, for a single action branch we have:


10


the probability the first state is unique


10


the probability the second state is unique (not equal to the first state)


10


the probability the third state is unique (not equal to the first or second state)


10


...


...


Since each of these sampled states is independent, this leads to the probability of all unique


states in the state space being selected with probability
