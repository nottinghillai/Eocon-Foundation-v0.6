# probabilistic reasoning

_Source page: 39_



Rational decision making requires reasoning about our uncertainty and objec-


tives. Uncertainty arises from practical and theoretical limitations on our ability to


predict future events. For example, predicting exactly how a human operator will


respond to advice from a decision support system would require, among other


things, a detailed model of how the human brain works. Even the paths of satel-


lites can be difficult to predict. Although Newtonian physics permit highly precise


predictions of satellite trajectories, spontaneous failures in attitude thrusters can


result in large deviations from the nominal path, and even small imprecisions can


compound over time. To achieve its objectives, a robust decision-making system


must account for various sources of uncertainty in the current state of the world


and future events. This part of the book begins by discussing how to represent un-


certainty using probability distributions. Real-world problems require reasoning


about distributions over many variables. We will discuss how to construct these


models, use them to make inferences, and learn their parameters and structure


from data. We then introduce the foundations of utility theory and show how it


forms the basis for rational decision making under uncertainty. Utility theory can


be incorporated into the probabilistic graphical models introduced earlier to form


what are called decision networks. We focus on single-step decisions, reserving


discussion of sequential decision problems for the next part of the book.
