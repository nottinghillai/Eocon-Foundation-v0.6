# Maximum Likelihood Estimates for Categorical Distributions

_Source page: 94_



Suppose that the random variable


represents whether a flight will result in


a midair collision, and we are interested in estimating the distribution


Because


is either


or


, it is sufficient to estimate the parameter


What we want to do is infer


from data


. We have a historical database spanning


a decade consisting of


flights with


midair collisions. Our intuition, of course,


tells us that a good estimate for


, given the data


, is


. Under the assumption


of independence of outcomes between flights, the probability of a sequence of


outcomes in


with


midair collisions is:
