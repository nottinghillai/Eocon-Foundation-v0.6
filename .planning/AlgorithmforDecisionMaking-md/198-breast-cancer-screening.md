# Breast Cancer Screening

_Source page: 25_



Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Detecting breast


cancer early can help save lives, with mammography being the most effective


screening tool available. However, mammography carries with it potential risks,


including false positives, which can result in unnecessary and invasive diagnos-


tic follow-up. Research over the years has resulted in various population-based


screening schedules based on age to balance the benefits and risks of testing.
