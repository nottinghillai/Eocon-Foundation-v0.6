Example 17.1. The effect of decay-


Consider estimating the expected value obtained when rolling a fair six-sided


ing the learning rate with different


die. What follows are


learning curves


that show the incremental estimates


functions for


over


100


trials associated with different learning rate functions. As we can


see, convergence is not guaranteed if


decays too quickly, and it is slow


if


does not decay quickly enough.


For constant values of
