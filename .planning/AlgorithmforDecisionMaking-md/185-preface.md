# Preface

_Source page: 19_



This book provides a broad introduction to algorithms for decision making under


uncertainty. We cover a wide variety of topics related to decision making, intro-


ducing the underlying mathematical problem formulations and the algorithms


for solving them. Figures, examples, and exercises are provided to convey the


intuition behind the various approaches.


This book is intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, as


well as professionals. It requires some mathematical maturity and assumes prior


exposure to multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and probability concepts. Some


review material is provided in the appendices. Disciplines where the book would


be especially useful include mathematics, statistics, computer science, aerospace,


electrical engineering, and operations research.


Fundamental to this textbook are the algorithms, which are all implemented


in the Julia programming language. We have found this language to be ideal for


specifying algorithms in human-readable form. The priority in the design of the


algorithmic implementations was interpretability rather than efficiency. Indus-


trial applications, for example, may benefit from alternative implementations.


Permission is granted, free of charge, to use the code snippets associated with


this book, subject to the condition that the source of the code is acknowledged.
