Exercise 21.1.


Suppose that we are in a variation of the straight-line hex world problem


(appendix F.1) consisting of four cells corresponding to states


. There are two actions:


1:4


move left (


) and move right (


). The effects of those actions are deterministic. Moving


left in


100


and ends the game. With a discount


or moving right in


gives a reward of


factor of


0.9


, compute alpha vectors using QMDP. Then, using the alpha vectors, compute


the approximately optimal action, given the belief
