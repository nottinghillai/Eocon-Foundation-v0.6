The optimization variables correspond to the parameters of


and


. At conver-


gence, the objective will be


, with


matching the utilities associated with policy


as computed in equation (24.1) for each agent


. The first constraint ensures that


no agent will do better by unilaterally changing their action. Like the objective,


this first constraint is nonlinear because it involves a product of the parameters in


the optimization variable


. The last two constraints are linear, ensuring that


represents a valid set of probability distributions over actions. Algorithm 24.5


implements this optimization procedure.
