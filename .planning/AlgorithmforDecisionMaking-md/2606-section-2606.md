denoted as


. Algorithm 20.1 provides an implementation of this.


A conditional plan tells us what to do in response to our observations up to


the horizon represented by the tree. To execute a conditional plan, we start with


the root node and execute the action associated with it. We proceed down the


tree according to our observations, taking the actions associated with the nodes


through which we pass.
