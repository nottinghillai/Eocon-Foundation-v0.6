. Since


0.3


) =


, the estimate is


0.2


, which


is the exact answer.


Exercise 14.5.


Suppose we have the following four policies, which have been evaluated


on three metrics that we want to maximize:


System


2.7


1.1


2.8


1.8


2.8


4.5


9.0


4.5


2.3


5.3


6.0


2.8


Which policies are on the Pareto frontier?


Solution:


Only


, and


is dominated by other policies. Hence,


are on the Pareto


frontier.
