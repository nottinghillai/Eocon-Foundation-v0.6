Psychologists also study human decision making, typically from the perspective


of human behavior. By studying the reactions of animals to stimuli, psychologists


have been developing theories of trial-and-error learning since the nineteenth


century. Researchers noticed that animals tend to make decisions based on the


satisfaction or discomfort they experienced in previous similar situations. Russian


psychologist Ivan Pavlov combined this idea with the concept of reinforcement


after observing the salivation patterns of dogs when fed. Psychologists found


that a pattern of behavior could be strengthened or weakened using continuous


reinforcement of a particular stimulus. In the mid-twentieth century, the mathe-


matician and computer scientist Alan Turing expressed the possibility of allowing


machines to learn in the same manner:


The organization of a machine into a universal machine would be most impressive if


the arrangements of interference involve very few inputs. The training of a human


child depends largely on a system of rewards and punishments, and this suggests


that it ought to be possible to carry through the organising with only two interfering


inputs, one for ‘‘pleasure’’ or ‘‘reward’’ (R) and the other for ‘‘pain’’ or ‘‘punishment’’
