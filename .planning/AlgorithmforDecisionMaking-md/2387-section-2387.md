. Example 18.1 applies a


discrete conditional model to data from the mountain car problem.


If we have a factored representation of our policy, we can use a Bayesian


network to represent the joint distribution over our state and action variables.


Figure 18.1 shows an example. We can learn both the structure (chapter 5) and
