, then a policy that consistently produces


0.5


will have the same feature


expectations as one that produces


half the time and


half the time.


Depending on what the feature encodes, this can result in very different policies. Any


set of continuous features can be discretized, and thus approximated by a set of binary


features.


Exercise 18.5.


Suppose we are building a system in a high-rise that must choose which


floor to send an elevator. We have trained several policies to match the feature expectations


of expert demonstrations, such as how long customers must wait for an elevator or how


long they have to wait to get to their destinations. We run multiple rollouts for each policy


and plot the relative duration spent on each floor. Which policy should we prefer according


to the principle of maximum entropy, assuming that each policy matches the feature


expectations equally?
