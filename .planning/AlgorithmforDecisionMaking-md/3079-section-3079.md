chapter 23. controller abstractions


will have better expected values for some states, and thus the overall controller


must be improved.


Many of the nodes added during policy improvement tend not to improve


the policy. Pruning is conducted after policy evaluation to eliminate unnecessary


nodes. Doing so does not degrade the optimal value function of the controller.


Pruning methods can help reduce the exponential growth in nodes that comes


with the improvement step. In some cases, pruning can enable loops to form,


resulting in compact controllers.


We prune any new nodes that are identical to existing nodes. We also prune


any new nodes that are


dominated


by other nodes. A node
