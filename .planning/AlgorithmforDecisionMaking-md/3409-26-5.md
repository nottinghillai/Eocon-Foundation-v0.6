Here,


is a joint distribution over the policies of other agents and the state. As


mentioned at the start of this chapter, it is generally infeasible to compute a


belief state, but equation (26.5) checks the space of beliefs for individual policy


domination.


A similar linear program was


We can construct a single linear program to check equation (26.5).
