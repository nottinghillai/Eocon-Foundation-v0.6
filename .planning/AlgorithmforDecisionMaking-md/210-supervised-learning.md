# Supervised Learning

_Source page: 28_



With some problems, it may be easier to show an agent what to do rather than to


write a program for the agent to follow. The designer provides a set of training


examples, and an automated learning algorithm must generalize from these exam-


ples. This approach is known as


supervised learning


and has been widely applied


to classification problems. This technique is sometimes called


behavioral cloning


when applied to learning mappings from observations to actions. Behavioral


cloning works well when an expert designer actually knows the best course of


action for a representative collection of situations. Although a wide variety of


different learning algorithms exist, they generally cannot perform better than


human designers in new situations.
