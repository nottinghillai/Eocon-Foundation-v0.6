Exercise 6.7.


Using the results from exercise 6.6, if


) =

) =


0.9


and


) =


0.3


, what is the value of information of asking someone else if the


puppy has recently been fed, given that we observe the puppy to be whining (


)?


Solution:


We are interested in computing


VOI


) =


EU


EU


We start by computing


EU


for all


and


. Following a similar derivation as in


exercise 6.6, we have


EU


) =


So, for each combination of


and


, we have the following expected utilities:
