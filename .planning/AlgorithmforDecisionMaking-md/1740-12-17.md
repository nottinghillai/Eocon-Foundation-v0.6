The next step involves replacing the state distribution with


. The quality of


the approximation degrades as


gets further from


, but it is hypothesized that


it is acceptable within the trust region. Since


does not depend on


, we can


drop it from the objective. We can also drop the state value function from the


advantage function, leaving us with the action value function. What remains is


referred to as the


surrogate objective
