In other words, the value of information about a variable is the increase in expected


utility if that variable is observed. Algorithm 6.2 provides an implementation of


this.

The value of information is never negative. The expected utility can increase


only if additional observations can lead to different optimal decisions. If observing


a new variable


makes no difference in the choice of action, then
