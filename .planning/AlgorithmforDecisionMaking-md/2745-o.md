The fast informed bound provides an upper bound on the optimal value


function. That upper bound is guaranteed to be no looser than that provided by


QMDP, and it also tends to be tighter. The fast informed bound is implemented


in algorithm 21.3 and is used in figure 21.2 to compute optimal value functions.
