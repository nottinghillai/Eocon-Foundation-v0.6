An agent must be able to quantify its uncertainty to make informed decisions in


uncertain environments. The field of decision making relies heavily on probability


theory for this task. In particular, Bayesian statistics plays an important role in this


text. In 1763, a paper of Thomas Bayes was published posthumously, containing


what would later be known as Bayes’ rule. His approach to probabilistic inference


fell in and out of favor until the mid-twentieth century, when researchers began to

Every operation involved in search is beset with uncertainties; it can be understood


quantitatively only in terms of [...] probability. This may now be regarded as a truism,


but it seems to have taken the developments in operational research of the Second

Sampling-based methods (sometimes referred to as

) devel-


oped in the early twentieth century for large-scale calculations as part of the


Manhattan Project, made some inference techniques possible that would pre-


viously have been intractable. These foundations serve as a basis for Bayesian


networks, which increased in popularity later in the twentieth century in the field


of artificial intelligence.
