Another approach to representing multimodal continuous distributions is


through discretization. For example, we can represent a distribution over a con-


tinuous variable as a


piecewise-uniform density


. The density is specified by the


bin edges, and a probability mass is associated with each bin. Such a piecewise-


uniform distribution is a type of mixture model where the components are uni-


form distributions.
