Another way to represent a continuous distribution is with a


cumulative distri-


bution function


(see figure 2.3), which specifies the probability mass associated


cdf


with values below some threshold. If we have a cumulative distribution function


Figure 2.3. The probability density


associated with variable


, then


represents the probability mass associ-


function and cumulative distribu-


ated with


taking on a value less than or equal to


. A cumulative distribution


tion function for a standard Gaus-


function can be defined in terms of a probability density function


as follows:


sian distribution.
