# Reinforcement Learning

_Source page: 29_



Reinforcement learning


relaxes the assumption in planning that a model is known


ahead of time. Instead, the decision-making strategy is learned while the agent


interacts with the environment. The designer only has to provide a performance


measure; it is up to the learning algorithm to optimize the behavior of the agent.


One of the interesting complexities that arises in reinforcement learning is that the


choice of action affects not only the immediate success of the agent in achieving its


objectives, but also the agent’s ability to learn about the environment and identify


the characteristics of the problem that it can exploit.
