Algorithmic approaches to decision making have transformed society and will


likely continue to in the future. This section briefly highlights a few ways that


decision-making algorithms can contribute to society and introduces challenges

field of multiagent systems are used to predict the operation of smart grids, design


markets for trading energy, and predict rooftop solar-power adoption. Algorithms


have also been developed to protect biodiversity. For example, neural networks


are used to automate wildlife censuses, game-theoretic approaches are used to

combat poaching in forests, and optimization techniques are employed to allocate


resources for habitat management.


Decision-making algorithms have found success in the field of medicine for


decades. Such algorithms have been used for matching residents to hospitals


and organ donors to patients in need. An early application of Bayesian networks,


which we will cover in the first part of this book, was disease diagnosis. Since


then, Bayesian networks have been widely used in medicine for the diagnosis and


prognosis of diseases. The field of medical image processing has been transformed


by deep learning, and algorithmic ideas have recently played an important role


in understanding the spread of disease.


Algorithms have enabled us to understand the growth of urban areas and


facilitate their design. Data-driven algorithms have been widely used to improve


public infrastructure. For example, stochastic processes have been used to predict


failures in water pipelines, deep learning has improved traffic management,


and Markov decision processes and Monte Carlo methods have been employed


to improve emergency response. Ideas from decentralized multiagent systems


have optimized travel routes, and path-planning techniques have been used to


optimize the delivery of goods. Decision-making algorithms have been used for


autonomous cars and improving aircraft safety.


Algorithms for optimizing decisions can amplify the impact of its users, regard-


less of their intention. If the objective of the user of these algorithms, for example,


is to spread misinformation during a political election, then optimization pro-


cesses can help facilitate this. However, similar algorithms can be used to monitor


and counteract the spread of false information. Sometimes the implementation


of these decision-making algorithms can lead to downstream consequences that

stand how the risk of bias can be reduced and how the benefits of algorithmic


progress can be distributed in a manner that is equitable and fair. Algorithms can


also be vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, and it is critical that we design


algorithms that are robust to such attacks. It is also important to extend moral


and legal frameworks for preventing unintended consequences and assigning


responsibility.
