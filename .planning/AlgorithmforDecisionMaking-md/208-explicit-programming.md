# Explicit Programming

_Source page: 27_



The most direct method for designing a decision-making agent is to anticipate all


the scenarios that the agent might find itself in and explicitly program what the


agent should do in response to each one. The explicit programming approach may


work well for simple problems, but it places a large burden on the designer to pro-


vide a complete strategy. Various agent programming languages and frameworks


have been proposed to make programming agents easier.
