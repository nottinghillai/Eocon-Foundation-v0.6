Solution:


The first set of weighting functions is not valid, as it violates the constraint


) =


. We can modify the weighting functions by normalizing them by their sum:


) =


The second set of weighting functions is valid. The third set of weighting functions is not


valid, as it violates the constraint


) =


. We can modify the weighting functions by


normalizing them by their sum:

Exercise 8.6.


Prove that bilinear interpolation is invariant under (nonzero) linear grid


scaling.


Solution:


It is straightforward to show that the interpolated value is invariant to a linear


scaling on one or both axes, such as,


) =


. We show this by substituting all


- and


-values by their scaled versions


and


, and showing that the grid


scalings cancel out:
