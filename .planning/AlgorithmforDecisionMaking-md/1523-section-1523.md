log


The term


with respect


contains the partial derivative of each entry of


to the log likelihood.


Directly updating


may not result in a positive definite matrix, as is


required for covariance matrices. One solution is to represent


as a product


, which guarantees that


remains positive semidefinite, and then to


update


instead. Replacing


by


and taking the gradient with respect


to


yields
