This textbook has grown from a course on decision making under uncertainty


taught at Stanford. We are grateful to the students and teaching assistants who


have helped shape the course over the past six years.


The authors wish to thank the many individuals who have provided valu-


able feedback on early drafts of our manuscript, including Dylan Asmar, Drew


Bagnell, Safa Bakhshi, Edward Balaban, Jean Betterton, Raunak Bhattacharyya,

Sunberg, Abiy Teshome, Alexandros Tzikas, Kemal Ure, Ziyu Wang, Josh Wolff,


Zhen Wu, Esen Yel, Anıl Yıldız, Shengtong Zhang, and Zongzhang Zhang. We


also would like to thank Sydney Katz, Kunal Menda, and Ayan Mukhopadhyay


for their contributions to the discussion in chapter 1. Ross Alexander produced


many of the exercises throughout the book. It has been a pleasure working with


Elizabeth Swayze from the MIT Press in preparing this manuscript for publication.


The style of this book was inspired by Edward Tufte. Among other stylistic


elements, we adopted his wide margins and use of small multiples. The type-


setting of this book is based on the Tufte-LaTeX package by Kevin Godby, Bil


Kleb, and Bill Wood. The book’s color scheme was adapted from the Monokai


theme by Jon Skinner of Sublime Text (sublimetext.com) and a palette that better

We have also benefited from the various open-source packages on which this


textbook depends (see appendix G). The typesetting of the code was done with


the help of pythontex, which is maintained by Geoffrey Poore. The typeface used


for the algorithms is JuliaMono (github.com/cormullion/juliamono). The plotting


was handled by pgfplots, which is maintained by Christian Feuersänger.
