chapter 24. multiagent reasoning


This equation holds for any action


. Consequently, applying any probability weighting


preserves the right side of this inequality. Consider any other policy


as a weighting:


) =


This inequality is the definition of a best response. It must hold for all agents


and thus


forms the definition of a Nash equilibrium. In summary, a Nash equilibrium is a special


kind of correlated equilibrium that is constrained to an uncorrelated joint policy.


Exercise 24.5.


Give an example of a two-agent game, each with two actions, for which the


correlated equilibria cannot be represented as a Nash equilibrium.


Solution:


Consider the following game, in which two people want to go on a date but have


a conflicting preference on what kind of date (in this case, a dinner or a movie):


agent


dinner


movie
