Exercise 6.1.


Suppose that we have a utility function


with a finite maximum value


and a finite minimum value


. What is the corresponding normalized utility function


that preserves the same preferences?


Solution:


A normalized utility function has a maximum value of


and a minimum value of


. Preferences are preserved under affine transforms, so we determine the affine transform


of


that matches the unit bounds. This transform is
