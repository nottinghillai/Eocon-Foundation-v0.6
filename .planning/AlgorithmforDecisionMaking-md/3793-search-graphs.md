# Search Graphs

_Source page: 622_



A search problem with finite state and action spaces can be represented as a


search graph


. The nodes correspond to states, and edges correspond to transitions


between states. Associated with each edge from a source to a destination state


are both an action that results in that state transition and the expected reward


when taking that action from the source state. Figure E.1 depicts a subset of such


a search graph for a


sliding tile puzzle.
