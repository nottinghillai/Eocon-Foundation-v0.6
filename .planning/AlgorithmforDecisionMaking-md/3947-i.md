prey


share the same hex with


pred


and prey


then the prey is devoured. The prey


is then transported to a random hex cell,


representing its offspring appearing in the world. Otherwise, the state transitions


are independent and are as described in the original hex world.


One or more predators can capture one or more prey if they all happen to be


in the same cell. If


predators and


prey all share the same cell, the predators


receive a reward of


. For example, if two predators capture one prey together,


they each get a reward of


1/2


. If three predators capture five prey together, they


each get a reward of


5/3


. Moving predators receive unit penalty. Prey can move


with no penalty, but they receive a penalty of


100


for being devoured.
