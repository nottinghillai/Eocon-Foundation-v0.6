chapter 12. policy gradient optimization


We can drop


from the objective since it does not depend on


. In addition,


we can change the inequality to an equality in the constraint because the linear


objective forces the optimal solution to be on the boundary of the feasible region.


These changes result in an equivalent optimization problem:


maximize
