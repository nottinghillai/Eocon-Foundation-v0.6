to represent samples from the distribution represented by


the expert data set


. We can alternate between gradient ascent on


to increase


the objective and trust region policy optimization (section 12.4) on


to reduce the


objective, generating the necessary trajectory samples from the policy to conduct


each of these steps. The discriminator provides a learning signal to the policy


similar to the way that a reward signal would if it were known.
