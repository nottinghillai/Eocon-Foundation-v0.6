The Bayesian score is more convenient to compute numerically because it is


easier to add the logarithm of small numbers together than to multiply small


numbers together. Many software libraries can compute the logarithm of the


gamma function directly.


A variety of graph priors have been explored in the literature, although a


uniform prior is often used in practice, in which case


log


can be dropped


from the computation of the Bayesian score in equation (5.5). Algorithm 5.1


provides an implementation.
