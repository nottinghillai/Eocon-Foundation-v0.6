As introduced in section 7.2, we can compute the expected discounted return


when following a policy


from a state


. This expected discounted return


can be computed iteratively (algorithm 7.3) or through matrix operations (algo-


rithm 7.4) when the state space is discrete and relatively small. We can use these


results to compute the expected discounted return of
