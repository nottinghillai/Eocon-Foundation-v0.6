The Gaussian distribution is


unimodal


, meaning that there is a point in the


distribution at which the density increases on one side and decreases on the


other side. There are different ways to represent continuous distributions that


are


multimodal


. One way is to use a


mixture model


, which is a mixture of multiple


distributions. We mix together a collection of unimodal distributions to obtain


a multimodal distribution. A


Gaussian mixture model


is a mixture model that is


simply a weighted average of various Gaussian distributions. The parameters of


a Gaussian mixture model include the parameters of the Gaussian distribution


components


, as well as their weights


. The density is given by
