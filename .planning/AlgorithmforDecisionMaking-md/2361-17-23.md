At each time step, unlike


-learning, we do not have to perform a maximization over


actions, so for


time steps, the complexity of Sarsa is simply


Exercise 17.5.


Is the computational complexity of Sarsa per experience tuple


more or less than that of Sarsa(


)?


Solution:


For Sarsa, our update rule is


) +
