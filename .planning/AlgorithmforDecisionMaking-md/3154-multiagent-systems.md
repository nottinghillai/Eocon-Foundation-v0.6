# multiagent systems

_Source page: 513_



Up to this point, we have focused on decision making from the perspective of


a single agent. We now extend the core concepts that we have discussed so far


to problems involving multiple agents. In multiagent systems, we can model


other agents as potential allies or adversaries and adapt accordingly over time.


These problems are inherently challenging due to complexities surrounding


agent interactions and agents reasoning about other agents who reason about


the agent, and so on. We begin by introducing multiagent reasoning in games


and outline how to compute equilibria from simple interactions. We then discuss


how to design algorithms for multiple agents interacting over time, describing


learning algorithms that favor rational adaptation over convergence to equilibria.


Introducing state uncertainty significantly increases problem complexity, and this


part emphasizes the resulting challenges. The final chapter focuses on the various


models and algorithms for collaborative agents that strive to work together with


a common objective.
