search problem


is concerned with finding an appropriate sequence of actions to


maximize the obtained reward over subsequent deterministic transitions. Search


problems are Markov decision processes (covered in part II) with determinis-


tic transition functions. Some well-known search problems include sliding tile


puzzles, the Rubik’s Cube, Sokoban, and finding the shortest path to a destination.
