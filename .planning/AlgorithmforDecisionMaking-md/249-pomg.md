duces state uncertainty, further generalizing MGs and POMDPs, as agents now


receive only noisy local observations. The

) focuses the POMG on a collaborative, multiagent


team where there is a shared reward among the agents. This part of the book


presents these four categories of problems and discusses exact and approximate


algorithms that solve them.
