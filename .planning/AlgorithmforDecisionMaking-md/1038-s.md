Figure 7.4. Exact policy evaluation


used to evaluate an east-moving


policy for the hex world problem.


The exact solution contains lower


values than what was contained in


the first few steps of iterative pol-


icy evaluation in figure 7.3. If we


ran iterative policy evaluation for


more iterations, it would converge


to the same value function.
