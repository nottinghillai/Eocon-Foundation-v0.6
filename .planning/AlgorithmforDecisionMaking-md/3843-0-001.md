The gravitational term in the speed update is what drives the underpowered


vehicle back toward the valley floor. Transitions are clamped to the bounds of the


state space.


The mountain car problem is a good example of a problem with delayed


return. Many actions are required to get to the goal state, making it difficult for an


untrained agent to receive anything other than consistent unit penalties. The best


learning algorithms are able to efficiently propagate knowledge from trajectories


that reach the goal back to the rest of the state space.
