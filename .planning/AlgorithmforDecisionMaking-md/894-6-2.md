Example 6.1 applies this equation to compute the utility of outcomes involving a


collision avoidance system.


Example 6.1. A lottery involving

whether a collision occurs (

and


are binary, there are four


possible outcomes. So long as our preferences are rational, we can write our


utility function over the space of possible lotteries in terms of four parameters:


, and
