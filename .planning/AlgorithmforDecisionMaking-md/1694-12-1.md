chapter 12. policy gradient optimization


where the step length is equal to a step factor


times the magnitude of the


gradient.


Algorithm 12.1 implements a method that takes such a step. This method can


be called for either a fixed number of iterations or until


or


converges.


Gradient ascent, as well as the other algorithms discussed in this chapter, is not


guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy. However, there are techniques to


This approach, as well as many
