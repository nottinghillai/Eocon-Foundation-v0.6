Figure 4.1. Suppose that we have


airspeed measurements

from


True


aircraft tracks, and we want


Estimated


to fit a Gaussian model. This


figure shows a Gaussian with


the maximum likelihood estimates


51.5 m/s


and


15.9 m/s


The ‘‘true’’ distribution is shown


for comparison. In this case, the


Gaussian is a fairly reasonable ap-


proximation of the true distribu-


tion.
