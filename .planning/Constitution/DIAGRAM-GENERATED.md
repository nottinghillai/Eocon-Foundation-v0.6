## How to Regenerate

### Using mermaid-cli Directly
```bash
cd .planning/Constitution
mmdc -i ../Diagrams/unified-framework-architecture.mermaid \
     -o unified-framework-architecture.pdf \
     -w 3200 -H 2400 -b white -s 2
```

### Using the Python Script
```bash
python tools/mermaid_to_image.py \
    .planning/Diagrams/unified-framework-architecture.mermaid \
    .planning/Constitution/unified-framework-architecture
```

---

## Update Diagram

When updating the Mermaid source file:

1. **Edit**: `.planning/Diagrams/unified-framework-architecture.mermaid`
2. **Regenerate**: Run one of the commands above
3. **Recompile**: LaTeX will automatically pick up the new diagram

---

## Troubleshooting

### Diagram Not Appearing
- ✅ Check file exists: `ls .planning/Constitution/unified-framework-architecture.pdf`
- ✅ Verify filename matches exactly in LaTeX
- ✅ Recompile LaTeX twice for references

### Quality Issues
- Increase resolution: `-w 4800 -H 3600` for even higher quality
- Adjust scale: `-s 3` for larger output
- Use PNG for lossless compression: `-o unified-framework-architecture.png`

### File Size
- PDF: ~90KB (vector format, scalable)
- PNG: ~560KB (raster format, fixed resolution)
- **Recommendation**: Use PDF for LaTeX (smaller, scalable)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Diagram generated and integrated
2. ✅ LaTeX compilation successful
3. ✅ Ready for use

The unified framework architecture diagram is now included in the Foundation Constitution PDF at high resolution!
