# 5. Expected Benefits & Validation

_Source page: 8_



5.1 Theoretical Advantages


The pipeline architecture is designed to reduce token consumption through:


Clarification Reduction


: Self-resolution using project history instead of user back-and-forth


Scope Constraint


: Explicit requirements prevent unrequested feature generation


Context Isolation


: Each wave file is self-contained, reducing context window size


Testing Structure


: Explicit test criteria eliminate speculative testing


5.2 Current Status


Important Note:


Actual measurements have not yet been conducted. The true efficacy of this architecture


requires empirical validation through controlled experiments.


Next Steps for Validation:


1. Pilot study with 3-5 small features using both traditional and pipeline approaches


2. Track total tokens, clarification rounds, and scope adherence


3. Analyze results and refine master_plan.md based on findings


4. Expand to 20+ features for statistical significance
