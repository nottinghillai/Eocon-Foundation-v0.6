# Abstract

_Source page: 1_



Large Language Model (LLM) based AI agents have become increasingly prevalent in software development


workflows, yet their token consumption often leads to inefficiencies, scope creep, and unnecessary


computational costs. This paper presents a novel structured pipeline architecture designed to reduce token usage


through explicit requirement decomposition, self-resolution mechanisms, and modular context isolation. By


introducing an immutable master plan guideline, feature-specific tactical plans, and wave-based task


decomposition with integrated testing frameworks, we demonstrate a systematic approach to preventing


assumption-based development while enabling parallel execution strategies. Our methodology evolved through


iterative collaboration, addressing real-world challenges in AI agent behavior including over-engineering,


ambiguity handling, and dependency management. While the theoretical framework shows promise for


significant efficiency gains, empirical validation is needed to quantify actual token savings and performance


improvements.
