# 7. Conclusion

_Source page: 9_



This research presents a comprehensive pipeline architecture for token-efficient AI agent-based software


development. Through iterative collaboration between Ashutosh and EJ, we evolved a simple planning


document into a sophisticated multi-phase system that addresses fundamental inefficiencies in LLM-based


development workflows.


Key Contributions:


1. Master Plan Pattern - Immutable guideline ensuring behavioral consistency


2. Self-Resolution Mechanism - Autonomous ambiguity resolution using project history


3. Wave-Based Modular Decomposition - Context-isolated sub-modules


4. Integrated Testing Framework - Test specifications generated during planning


5. Dependency-Based Stage Calculation - Enabling theoretical parallel execution


The evolution from a simple


plan.md


to a comprehensive multi-phase pipeline illustrates an important


principle:


constraint enables efficiency


. By restricting what agents can assume, we paradoxically empower


them to work more effectively.


Next Steps:


The theoretical framework is complete. The critical next phase is empirical validation through


controlled experiments to measure actual token usage, time savings, and quality improvements.
