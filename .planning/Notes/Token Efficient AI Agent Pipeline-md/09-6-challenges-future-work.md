# 6. Challenges & Future Work

_Source page: 9_



6.1 Current Limitations


Project History Dependency


: Self-resolution requires substantial project history to be effective


Agent Capability Requirements


: Requires Claude Sonnet 4.5+ or GPT-4+ level models


Implementation Phase Gap


: Phase 4 (actual implementation) is currently theoretical


Measurement and Validation


: No controlled experiments conducted yet


6.2 Future Research Directions


Empirical Validation


: Conduct controlled experiments to measure actual token savings


Multi-Agent Orchestration


: Implement Phase 4 with parallel execution


ML for History Querying


: Improve self-resolution through embedding-based pattern matching


CI/CD Integration


: Automatically validate wave completion using test specifications
