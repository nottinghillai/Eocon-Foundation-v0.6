## 🏗️ The Unified Framework

### 6 Phases, 5 Agents

```
Phase 0: Constitution Agent
   ↓ (Speech → C0 + C1...CN)
Phase 1: Planner Agent
   ↓ (Constitutions → Wave-based Plans)
Phase 2: Question Agent
   ↓ (Plans → Questions.md)
Phase 3: Optimization Agent (Senior Engineer)
   ↓ (Questions → Optimized Plans + Tests)
Phase 4: Stages Agent
   ↓ (Plans → stages.md + DAG)
Phase 5: Parallel Execution
   ↓ (Test-Driven Generation)
Complete Constellation
```

### Key Innovations

1. **Wave-Based Decomposition**
   - Plans broken into digestible sub-plans
   - Token-efficient context isolation
   - One-shot model execution optimization

2. **Autonomous Self-Resolution**
   - Optimization Agent answers questions automatically
   - Historical pattern learning (Guides/, Design/, Docs/)
   - Decision logging with complete rationale

3. **Test-Driven Planning**
   - Tests generated DURING planning (not after)
   - Immediate validation post-generation
   - Parallel debugging of code + tests

4. **Dependency-Aware Parallel Execution**
   - Automatic DAG construction
   - Stage-based parallel processing
   - Critical path identification

5. **Speech-to-Constitution**
   - Whisper algorithm integration
   - Natural language → Structured documentation
   - C0 (root) + CN (micro-apps)
