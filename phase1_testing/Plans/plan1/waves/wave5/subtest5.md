# Tests for Wave 5: Optimization & Extras

Created test specifications for Wave 5: Optimization & Extras.
The document includes 10 test cases covering:
**Unit tests (6):**
- Redis cache service (connection, health checks, reconnection)
- Statistics caching (cache hit/miss, TTL handling)
- Listening history caching (cache-first loading, TTL)
- Recommendations caching (type-specific TTL, cache warming)
- Cache invalidation (atomic operations, batch invalidation)
- Cache monitoring (hit rate tracking, memory usage, alerting)
**Integration tests (4):**
- Statistics API with caching
- Listening history API with caching
- Recommendations API with caching
- Cache monitoring API
**E2E tests (4):**
- Complete statistics flow with caching
- Recommendations cache warming flow
- Cache failure and fallback flow
- Cache monitoring and alerting flow
All tests reference specific features from the wave, include performance targets (>70% hit rate, <50ms cached responses), and are organized by implementation priority. The document is saved at `Plans/plan1/waves/wave5/test_specifications.md`.
